# JIE Mastery AI Tutor - Web Application

## Overview
The JIE Mastery AI Tutor is a production-ready conversational AI tutoring web platform offering personalized education across Math, English, and Spanish in 25 languages. It features a multi-agent AI system with five age-specific tutors (K-2, Grades 3-5, 6-8, 9-12, College/Adult) utilizing an Adaptive Socratic Method. The platform provides interactive voice conversations, personalized quizzes, and adaptive learning paths, aiming to make high-quality AI tutoring globally accessible and improve educational outcomes, with flexible family sharing and a hybrid minute tracking policy.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Timezone display: All timestamps display in America/Chicago (Central Time) using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Architecture
The platform uses React 18+ (TypeScript, Vite, Wouter) for the frontend, Node.js 20 (Express.js, TypeScript) for the backend, and PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM for the database. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui. State management uses TanStack Query v5, and authentication is session-based via Passport.js.

### Request Flow
Client requests (HTTPS/WSS) are processed by an Express.js server. HTTP routes manage data storage and PostgreSQL interactions, while WebSocket connections handle custom voice interactions, integrating with Speech-to-Text (STT), AI response generation, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) services.

### Custom Voice Stack
A custom voice stack delivers real-time, low-latency (1-2 seconds end-to-end) voice conversations using PCM16 audio over WebSockets. It integrates an STT provider, Claude Sonnet 4 for AI responses, and ElevenLabs TTS with age-specific voices. Features include adaptive barge-in detection, bounded patience logic, robust background noise handling, and production-hardening mechanisms like mic health monitoring and an LLM watchdog. Client-side VAD profiles and TTS text sanitization are adjusted per age group. A server-side Continuation Guard provides two-phase commit for user turns with grade-band-driven grace timing. An elite barge-in system uses monotonic `playbackGenId`, `AbortController` for LLM/TTS, and a `hardInterruptTutor()` function. Client-side Silero VAD provides neural speech detection for a two-stage barge-in system. Keyterms are provided to STT for subject-specific vocabulary.

### Content Moderation & Safety
A balanced, context-aware moderation system uses keyword whitelists and multi-layered AI moderation. Critical safety incidents trigger immediate session termination, parent notifications, and internal alerts, with all actions logged and non-fatal.

### Session Management & Billing
The `finalizeSession()` function ensures robust session completion. Minute enforcement prioritizes trial status, subscription limits, monthly allocation, and bonus minutes. A session-first data priority model allows per-session configuration for grade level, subject, and language, facilitating flexible family sharing.

### AI & Learning Engine
The primary AI model is Claude Sonnet 4.6 (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) with a 200k token context window and a temperature of 0.7. It implements a Modified Adaptive Socratic Method with Guided Discovery, Direct Instruction, understanding checks, and frustration detection. Five distinct tutor personalities cater to specific age groups.

### Age-Based Visual Engagement System
The platform features five distinct age themes (K-2, Grades 3-5, 6-8, 9-12, College) that define colors, fonts, emojis, and avatar styles. Age-specific visual components include `TutorAvatar`, `AnimatedBackground`, `SessionProgress`, and `Celebration` effects, built with Framer Motion and respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`. The voice session UI maintains a consistent layout with controls, tutor avatar, progress, mode selector, transcript, and sticky chat input.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System
The RAG system supports various document formats. The processing pipeline involves upload, text extraction, chunking, embedding (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small), and storage in `pgvector`. OCR supports 25 languages. Documents are activated per-session for LLM injection, with a one-time tutor greeting acknowledging up to 3 active documents.

### Continuity Memory System
A per-student memory system provides cross-session context. Upon session conclusion, a background job generates a structured summary using Claude. At session start, the last 5 summaries are injected into the Claude prompt. The system uses a DB-based job queue with retry logic and is non-blocking with safe fallbacks. Returning students receive adaptive continuity greetings, and a "First-Turn-Only Guarantee" prevents duplicate greetings. Strict student isolation is enforced.

### Database Schema & Migrations
Core database tables include `users`, `sessions`, `students`, `user_documents`, `content_violations`, `minute_purchases`, `session_summaries`, and `memory_jobs`. Production-safe migration guards ensure idempotent schema updates.

### Trial & Payment System
A 30-minute account-based trial system is implemented with abuse prevention. Stripe is integrated for subscription management, one-time purchases, and a hybrid minute tracking system. Email verification tokens are valid for 7 days, with daily reminders sent to unverified users.

### Admin Dashboard & Background Jobs
A comprehensive admin dashboard offers user, subscription, and session management, content violation review, and marketing tools. Key background jobs include daily digest emails for parents, document cleanup, and an embedding worker. An email digest system allows parents to receive session summaries per-session, daily, or weekly.

### Production Deployment
The platform is designed for Replit Autoscale Deployment, supporting WebSockets, horizontal scaling, and managed PostgreSQL.

### Enhanced Email & Learning Observation System
The platform features a 9-section enhanced email report sent per-session, replacing the original basic summary. This includes narrative summaries, performance snapshots, strengths, areas to strengthen, recommended follow-ups, and session highlights. A `learning_observations` table tracks rolling per-student metrics across sessions, broken down by subject, with observation flags requiring a 5-session minimum and a 2-of-last-3 stability window before appearing.
