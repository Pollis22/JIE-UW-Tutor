## 💰 Business Model

### Subscription Plans
- **Starter:** $19.99/month → 60 minutes
- **Standard:** $29.99/month → 120 minutes
- **Pro:** $49.99/month → 240 minutes

### One-Time Purchases
- **Top-up:** $9.99 → 60 minutes (never expires!)

**Key Insight:** Purchased minutes rollover indefinitely, encouraging users to buy extra minutes without fear of losing them.

## 🔑 Key Features Explained

### Session-First Design
Instead of creating separate accounts for each child, one family account can:
- Switch between different grade levels per session
- Use different subjects each time
- Support multiple children on the same subscription

### Document-Based Learning (RAG System)
1. Student uploads their homework PDF
2. AI processes and understands the content
3. During voice session, AI references the actual homework
4. Tutoring is personalized to their specific assignment

Example: "I see you're working on quadratic equations from Chapter 5. Let's talk about the first problem on page 47..."

### Hybrid Minute Tracking
```
Scenario: User has Starter plan (60 subscription minutes) + bought 60 top-up minutes

Month 1:
- Uses 80 minutes
- 60 from subscription (exhausted)
- 20 from purchased (40 purchased minutes left)

Month 2:
- Subscription resets to 60
- Still has 40 purchased minutes
- Total available: 100 minutes
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### How a Voice Session Works
```
1. Student logs in, selects grade/subject
2. Optional: Upload homework document
3. Start voice session
4. System checks minute balance
5. If document uploaded:
   - AI reads relevant sections
   - Uses content in conversation
6. Real-time voice conversation begins
7. Transcript saved live
8. Session ends → minutes deducted
9. Transcript available for review
```

### Document Processing Pipeline
```
Upload PDF → Extract Text → Break into Chunks
    ↓
Generate AI Embeddings → Store in Vector Database
    ↓
When student asks question:
    ↓
Find relevant chunks → Include in AI context → Better answers
```
